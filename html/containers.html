  <!-- blue is 100% wide until extra large breakpoint, green is 100% wide until extra large breakpoint, yellow is 100% wide until
  large breakpoint, orange is 100% wide until medium breakpoint, red is 100% wide until small breakpoint
Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints. 
For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, lg, xl, and xxl.-->


<div class="container-xl bg-primary pb-5">blue is 100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
